# AES Encryption in C

The following files within this folder are used to compile a test input that gets encrypted and then decrypted with AES. `make` will automatically compile the code into an executable binary that runs a benchmark to validate that the encryption and decryption worked properly. 

This binary (`./aes`) has already been created for your convenience.
