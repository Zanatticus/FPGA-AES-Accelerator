# Project Update 1

We implemented the software implementation of AES encryption (results for 256-bit keys). 
We made and tested our own implementation of AES encryption that does not use any external libraries featured in `AES.py` and its respective Jupyter Notebook file `AES.ipynb`.
We also included an implementation using Pycryptodome (i.e. external libraries) featured in `aes_module.py` and its respective Jupyter Notebook file, `aes_module.ipynb`.

## Instructions

To run the code that includes printed timing results, use the Jupyter Notebook files. 
Otherwise, calling `python3 main.py` will run the Python script for our implementation of AES encryption, and 
calling `python3 aes_module.py` will run the Python script using external Pycryptodome libraries.

## Output

The timing results can be seen in the print output in the Jupyter Notebook files [AES.ipynb](https://github.com/Zanatticus/FPGA_AES_Accelerator/blob/main/Project_Update_1/AES.ipynb) and [aes_module.ipynb](https://github.com/Zanatticus/FPGA_AES_Accelerator/blob/main/Project_Update_1/aes_module.ipynb)
