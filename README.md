# FPGA AES Accelerator

This project explores hardware optimizations on an FPGA to accelerate Advanced Encryption Standard as well as a power-analysis-based side-channel monitor/attack.

- The initial Python software attempt for our AES algorithm resides in `./AES_SW/` along with the algorithm's timing results in `./Project_Update_1/`
- The second project update contains the initial hardware implementations and ring oscillator implementation for the power monitor
- The final project update contains all finalized implementations
