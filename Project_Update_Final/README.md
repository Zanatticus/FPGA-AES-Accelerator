# Final Project

## AES Encryption and Decryption Implementations

`./AES_AXIS_HLS/` contains all files related to our baseline (unoptimized) Vitis/Vivado/Overlay hardware implementation

`./AES_AXIS_HLS_Optimized/` contains all files related to our optimized Vitis/Vivado/Overlay hardware implementation

`./AES_C/` contains all files related to our AES encryption algorithm in pure C code

`./AES_Python/` contains all files related to our AES encryption algorithm in pure Python code

*All AES implementations run the same AES algorithm (not including the difference due to hardware optimizations)*


## Hardware Monitor

`./Hacking_Time/` contains all files related to the ring oscillator hardware monitor
